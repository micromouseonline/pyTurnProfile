# Some thoughts on further development

 - Make the reset button work
 - Possibly lose the refresh button as it is redundant
 - Load/save parameters for existing turns
 - Extend the maze view to allow visualisation of wider turns like SS90K
 - Separate the output plots into a set of four or six smaller, individual plots
 - Switch between classic and half-size
 - Import/export parameters as C/C++ declarations
